This GitHub shows the documentation for a smart home device monitoring system using Prometheus for data collection and monitoring, 
Grafana for data visualization, and AWS Lambda to create fucntions to simulate data. The system simulation will monitor a smart
plug's energy consumption. Using AlertManager from Grafana Elderly users will be able to receive notifications based on the energy
changes that indicate if appliances are on or off. Notifications will be sent based on real-time data and enhance automation to 
optimize system intelligence.
