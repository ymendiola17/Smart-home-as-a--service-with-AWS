Project Description:  
This GitHub shows the documentation for a smart home device monitoring system using Prometheus for metrics collection and monitoring, 
Grafana for metrics visualization and alerting, AWS Lambda to create functions to simulate data, and API Gateway to allow communication
between AWS Lambda functions and Prometheus data collection layer. The system simulation will monitor a smart plug's energy consumption. 
In this simulation, different appliances will be connected to the smart plug which will campture the energy consumption of each of them.
Using AlertManager from Grafana Elderly users will be able to receive notifications based on the energy changes that indicate if 
appliances are on or off. Notifications will be sent based on real-time data and enhance automation to optimize system intelligence.
